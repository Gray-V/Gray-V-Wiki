        <strong>Villains</strong> is a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) that blends the excitement of TTRPGs with the structure of card games. Players take on the role of super villains navigating the city of Exilon to complete objectives, battle heroes, and indulge in acts of villainy. 
        The game emphasizes collaborative storytelling, improvisation, and imaginative gameplay.
